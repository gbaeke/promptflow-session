# How to run

Simply run `streamlit run app.py` in the terminal. The app will open in your default web browser.

Note that this app rins the flow in the parent folder and that it uses the connections configured on your system.

You can override these connections: see https://github.com/microsoft/promptflow/blob/main/examples/tutorials/get-started/flow-as-function.ipynb
